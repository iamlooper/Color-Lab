# Seeker

A app to seek customization.

## Description 

Introducing Seeker, the ultimate customization app for your device. With Seeker, you can easily personalize the look of your device to suit your unique style. Whether you want to change the system theme or adjust the theme of background, Seeker makes it easy to do so.

One of the most exciting features of Seeker is the ability to apply pure AMOLED black background theme. This theme is specifically designed for users who want the optimal visual experience on their AMOLED display. By using a black background, the AMOLED display is able to turn off the individual pixels for that color, resulting in true black and increased contrast, leading to an overall better visual experience.

In addition to the AMOLED black theme, Seeker also offers a variety of other themes and customization options for you to choose from. So why settle for a generic, boring look when you can make your device truly your own with Seeker? Download now and start customizing!

## Notes
- Seeker will not work in those ROMs which use their own monet implementation instead of Google's. Support for those ROMs may come in future versions.
- Every device is not compatible so kindly note this before giving feedback.
